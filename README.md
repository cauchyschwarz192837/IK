This is a reference implemention of inverse kinematics (IK) on 3 joints with 9 degrees of freedom using the numerical Jacobian Transpose method. This was later adapted for intern work at Creativex Consulting Pte Ltd in 2022. Actual code cannot be shared, but a short video demo can be found here at https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jOmvSfiN6L8.
